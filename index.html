        <h2>The Rules</h2>
        <p>You have been tasked with creating a series of magic potions.</p>
        <p>The primary ingredients come from the four types of crystals which are native to the 4 kingdoms of the land.
            Each has unique properties required to craft a number of magical outcomes.</p>
        <p>The number given is the precise value you must achieve to complete the listed concontion.</p>
        <p>Click on each crystal to add one to your current potion mix. Each one will get you closer to the required
            number needed to complete your potion. Match the number exactly, and you will add one more magical potion to
            your arsenal, but beware, as if you overdo it, the results could be disasterous!</p>
        <p>Each crystal will add a differnt amount to your potion, but you won't know how much until you add it. Also,
            each crystal will add a differnt amount to each potion. Pay attention as you add, and think carefully to
            avoid overdoing it.</p>
